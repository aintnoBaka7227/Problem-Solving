PrefixFreeSets problem:
Initial thoughts: I am using Brute Force and Greedy to solve this problem. I will use a nested for loop, the outer will loop through 
each string, while the inner will loop through every string and check if whether two strings with different indexes are prefix of the other,
if yes count - 1 (count is set to input array length for each outer loop). At the end of each outer loop, the count is stored in a vector.
Then I sort the vector and return the smallest value.
