# this is a log book for week 3

For this week, I want to practice using recursive approach to solve problems. However, if I can not solve it using recursion, I may find other approaches.

FracCount problem:

Initial thought: this problem can be solved using recursion. I can create another private function that take 3 parameters: int numerator, int denominator
and int count. count is used to count the position and initialized as 1. My base case will be 1/2 and return count immediately. If not I used a while loop
to check if there are any irreducable fractions with the denominator value. This can be check by using gcd(). If yes, increment count by one. At the end I 
return the recursive funcition with new count, decremented denominator and new numerator with value == the largest possible value based on the returned 
denominator.

Reflection:
