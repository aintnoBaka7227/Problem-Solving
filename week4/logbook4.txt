# this is a log book for week 4

ImportantTasks problem:

Initial thoughts: This can be solved using brute force and greedy. I can sort both arrays in ascending orders and loop through the complexity array.
For each index in complexity array, I check with the corresponding position in computers array, if the computers can handle it then I moved
on to the next complexity, if not then I move the index by one in computers array to check if there is a computer that can handle the task.
If found then increment the count by one. This process will stop at the moment when one complexity is over the complexity that all available
computers can handle.
