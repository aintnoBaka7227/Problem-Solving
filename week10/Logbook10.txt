BridgeSort problem:
Initial thoughts: This problem can be solved using brute force. I can loop and sort the hand string based on the suit. This can be done using bubble sort. 
Then if two consecutive suit is similar, I can just check the values of them and swap if the next card value is smaller than the current card value.
