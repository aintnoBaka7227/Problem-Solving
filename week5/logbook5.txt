# this is a log book for week 5

# this week is for dynamic programming. At least I need to solve 2 probs involves dynamic approach.

RunLengthDecoding problem:

Initial thoughts: Brute Force to core. My idea is to loop through the entire string, each time a number is encountered, I recorded the value and 
decode the correspond character based on that number. 1 while loop is used to handle the number and increment index. 

Reflection: This is a fast and easy approach. some might use recursion but I prefer this way.
