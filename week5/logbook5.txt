# this is a log book for week 5

# this week is for dynamic programming. At least I need to solve 2 probs involves dynamic approach.

RunLengthDecoding problem:

Initial thoughts: Brute Force to core. My idea is to loop through the entire string, each time a number is encountered, I recorded the value and 
decode the correspond character based on that number. 1 while loop is used to handle the number and increment index. 
P/s: Got into problem with my implementation because of 
two reasons: 1. fix directly on text string -> unexpected behavior when for loop use text.length() as condition; 2. number can be up to two digits
but my implementation only check 1. How did I fix it: create another string called decoded_text. This string will add each letter if there is nothing
to decode, else it will add the decoded parts. Let see if it worked

Reflection: This is a fast and easy approach. some might use recursion but I prefer this way. I need to be more careful when implement it as there are 
cases that I might potentially miss or fixing on provided parameters.
